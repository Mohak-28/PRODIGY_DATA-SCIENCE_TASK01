image processing 
exp 1: image resing 
Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
The cv2.resize() function is used to resize an python image in OpenCV.

exp 2: Image Rotation
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 

exp 3: Image Translation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
To translate an image using OpenCV, we need to create a transformation matrix. This matrix is a 2×3 matrix that specifies the amount of translation in each direction.

exp 4: Sheared image
Image shearing is a geometric transformation that skews an image along one or both axes i.e x or y axis.
To shear an image using OpenCV, we need to create a transformation matrix. This matrix is a 2×3 matrix that specifies the amount of shearing in each direction.

 exp5: image normalization
 Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing algorithms.

 exp 6: Edge detection of Image
 The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image.

 exp 7: Image Blurring
Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood. This can be done to reduce noise, soften edges, or make it harder to identify a picture

exp 8:Morphological Image Processing 
Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image. These procedures are commonly used to eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images.
